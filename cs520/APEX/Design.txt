Instruction class abstracts all data about an instruction which can exist.

APEX class is the actual processor which has functions for each stage and pipeline registers for simulation.

The simulation is performed by repeated executing the 5 functions.

Flags used for communication between various stages for stall conditions & branching.

Branching if takes place,then flushes the Fetch& Decode stages. If not, then the follow through is executed withoutany kind of stalls.

Dependencies are being taken care of by using a boolean flag for each register. If for any destination or source register, the flag is set to false, then the instruction stalls in the decode stage itself.

Memory dependecy are NOT being taken care of.
